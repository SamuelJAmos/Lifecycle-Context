### Overview
**Success Metrics Evaluation** involves assessing the project against predefined success criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs). This step is essential for determining whether the project met its objectives and identifying areas of success and improvement.

### Key Steps
- **Define Success Metrics**: Establish clear metrics and KPIs that align with the project's goals and objectives[^1].
- **Collect Data**: Gather data related to the success metrics from various sources such as analytics tools, user feedback, and performance reports[^2].
- **Analyze Results**: Evaluate the collected data to determine the project's performance against the defined success metrics[^3].
- **Report Findings**: Compile the findings into a comprehensive report, highlighting key achievements and areas for improvement[^4].
