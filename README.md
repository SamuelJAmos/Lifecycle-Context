# Digital Product Development Lifecycle

## Intro

Are you gearing up to create a new app or website? Here, you'll find high-level practices and strategic insights tailored to guide your project's complexity. This guide is designed to steer you towards success, helping you focus on critical aspects such as problem-solving rather than getting overwhelmed by the process.

I wrote this because this process has given a lot of stress. Mistakes were made, lessons were learned, and too many headaches were had. By sharing these insights, I hope not only to organize my thoughts but also to aid others who might find themselves facing similar challenges.

Expect a straightforward approach here. We’ll dive into essential phases like Discovery, Design, and Development, discussing what each entails and how they contribute to a successful product. This guide is built from my experiences—it’s opinionated but grounded in real-world applications.

[^1]:**Vertical Slicing**: A development approach where features are divided into smaller, manageable pieces that include all application layers—from user interface to database. This method facilitates Agile practices by allowing for iterative development and testing of complete features, ensuring efficient progress, faster feedback, and high-quality outputs.
