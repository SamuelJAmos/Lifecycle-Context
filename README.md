# Digital Product Development Lifecycle

## Intro

Are you gearing up to create a new app or website? Here, you'll find high-level practices and strategic insights tailored to guide your project's complexity. This guide is designed to steer you towards success, helping you focus on critical aspects such as problem-solving rather than getting overwhelmed by the process.

I wrote this because this process has given a lot of stress. Mistakes were made, lessons were learned, and too many headaches were had. By sharing these insights, I hope not only to organize my thoughts but also to aid others who might find themselves facing similar challenges.

Expect a straightforward approach here. We’ll dive into essential phases like Discovery, Design, and Development, discussing what each entails and how they contribute to a successful product. This guide is built from my experiences—it’s opinionated but grounded in real-world applications.

#### Recommendations for Further Enhancement (For Discovery Phase)
1. Visual Aids: Incorporate diagrams, charts, and other visual aids to illustrate key points, such as Gantt charts for timelines or stakeholder matrices for identifying key stakeholders.

2. Checklists: Provide checklists at the end of each section to help users ensure they have covered all necessary steps before moving on to the next phase.

3. Case Studies: Include more detailed case studies or real-world examples to show how the principles and steps have been applied successfully in various projects.

4. Templates: Offer templates for project plans, risk assessments, stakeholder interview questions, and budget planning to give users practical tools they can customize for their projects.

5. Glossary of Terms: Add a glossary of key terms and definitions to help users who may be unfamiliar with specific project management terminology.

6. Interactive Elements: If this guide is to be published online, consider adding interactive elements like clickable links to templates, downloadable resources, or embedded videos for deeper explanations.
