# Digital Product Development Lifecycle

## Intro

So you have an app or website you want to create? Here are some high-level practices to follow/consider depending on how detailed the project needs to be. This will set you up for success. Think of the more important things relating to the project, such as the problems to be solved. Instead of thinking about where do I start or what do I do next.

My reason for writing this is simple. I'm a fool. I always have been and always will be. I want to try to organize something helpful for me and maybe one day it'll reach others and help them break through some of the issues that have cost me a lot of time, headaches, and confusion. 

This is going to be rather opinionated. I will break down the high-level examples as appropriate.

[^1]: **Vertical Slicing**: A development approach where features are divided into smaller, manageable pieces that include all application layersâ€”from user interface to database. This method facilitates Agile practices by allowing for iterative development and testing of complete features, ensuring efficient progress, faster feedback, and high-quality outputs.
